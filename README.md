1. Please Note that there are few react libs which are required to be installed.

2. For **Oauth2.0** I have used a library called "**react-simple-oauth2-login**"

- a. The Login button is Clicked on **componentDidMount()** on very first refresh.

- b. The **Oauth2.0** validation is also taking place on every refresh.

- c. The refresh_token & expiry time is not considered in this assignment.

3. The **React.StrictMode** is removed from **src/index.js** as it was rendering the **Discover** twice.

4. Please configure the **src/config.js** and replace the clientId to a useful one.
